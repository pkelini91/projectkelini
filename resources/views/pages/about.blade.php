            <p class="lead">Hello my name is Peter Kelini and this is my first semester at njit. I was born in Egypt and moved to the Undted States
            when i was seven years old. I really like this class so far, I am learning a lot. At first like everything it was difficult at first but then
            you learn to get the hang of it. I will graduate with a masters degree in Business and Information Systems soon. Hopefully i can use the knowledge I learned during the
            course of this class be succesful in my future carrer!</p></div>
